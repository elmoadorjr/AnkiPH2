Case 1: I attempted to Subscribe to an Anki Deck via Addon - Result: Subscribe Failed - No Download URL

Case 2: I deleted a previously installed Deck - Deck Management - still shows Installed and Up to date.

Case 3: I unsubscribed from a Deck - Result: Deck is still subscribed - And still gives option to Unsubscribe.

Case 4: I downloaded a 23 card deck - Result: it worked but there was a short freeze - and is bad for UX.

Case 5: I click the AnkiPH login_dialog's Forgot Password and Register Now links - No dedicated Forgot Password page or Forgot Password dialog in webapp not triggered AnD/or SignUp tab in /auth not opened.

case 6: I sign up - Deck rebuild - is slow - delayed at least 1 second.

case 7: Im on free tier limited access account - i click browse decks in deck management - and nottorney collection which is a paid deck is displayed - i click install - it sorta allows me but there is an error from case 1 - in which case IF case 1 was fixed - and downloading a paid deck did allow?? then it would be broken - because free tier accounts - cant download paid decks.

Case 8: Im not logged in- im aware of this - i click AnkiPH button in topnav - it shows me a blank Dialog that has a button Sign IN - I click it and leads me to Login_dialog - but i feel like this part is unnecessary - and interferes with user UX - because if im not logged in - why not just call Login_dialog first.

case 9: Im in deck management - logged in - i click the Browse Decks button. Browse Decks dialog shows up. Its ugly. and just a list.

case 10: im in deck management - logged in - i click the Browse decks button. browse decks dialog shows up. i can see that I am subscribed in 2 decks. I go to the Ankiph collections page where I am signed in the same account. I unsubscribe from both said decks. I recheck in anki addon. click browse decks again. But it shows that Im still subscribed to both said decks. I log out. sign in the same account - click browse decks- and it now shows that im unsubscribed to both said decks - ISSUE: no refresh in browse decks - no real-time updates- ux not good.

case 7: Im on free tier limited access account - i click browse decks in deck management - and nottorney collection which is a paid deck is displayed - i click install -and downloading a paid deck is allowed. WHY? free tier accounts shouldnt be able to download paid decks. - backend should not allow - free tier users to subscribe to paid decks - because once they can subscribe - they can sync it freely via addon. If this is a backend issue-only then do nothing.

case 12: MAIN Dialog UI - is ugly and confusing and jarring - and dumb.

case 13: About UI - in settigns dialog - sucks - text are hidden - and dialog needs to be stretched downward to reveal them.

case 16: I opened deck management - clicked browse decks - then browse decks dialog opened - and it let me subscribe to a free tier deck - but after I subscribed - it automatically installed it - should this be automatic? Maybe? i think it being automatic makes it simple - but user should be informed that it will be downloaded automatically when they subscribe via either addon or webapp.

case 17: I am syncing a 33000 card deck - and downloading UI sucks - its just a text - of 1000/33000 - no UI or beauitiful dialog or something actually modern???

case 18: just synced the 33,000+ cards nottorney deck - but it shows specifically i synced only 32655 decks - i dont know if this is the actual number of cards that is from the Nottorney Collection in database - there might be missing cards synced??? or leakage?



Case X: Deck Management - each deck's Open in Web button - doesnt actually link the the decks's specific page in collection or deck/id page.

Case Y: UNKNOWN STATE - whether working or not working - 1. Study Progress Sync 2. Protected Fields 3. Advanced Tab is just dumb and too confusing.

case Z: ui files i dont know the purpose for:
a. advanced_sync_dialog.py
b. history_dialog.py
c. suggestion_dialog.py
d. sync_dialog.py
e. tabbed_dialog.py

BOTH BACKEND AND ADDON:

CRITICAL ISSUE 1: 

"Deck creation feature coming soon!

You can create decks at:
https://ankiph.lovable.app"


BACKEND - ISSUES:
Case 5: I click the AnkiPH login_dialog's Forgot Password and Register Now links - No dedicated Forgot Password page or Forgot Password dialog in webapp not triggered AnD/or SignUp tab in /auth not opened.
